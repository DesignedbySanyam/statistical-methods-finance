# Statistical Methods for Finance — Final Project (STAT GR5261)

This repository contains our final project for **STAT GR5261 (Statistical Methods for Finance)**.  
We analyze a diversified universe of **10 assets** (Technology, Commodities, Crypto, Consumer Staples) and apply statistical methods to **construct optimal portfolios** and **evaluate risk**, including tail-risk behavior.

## Project Overview

We study monthly returns from **Dec 2020 to Dec 2025** across:

- **Tech/Growth:** NVDA, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT  
- **Commodities/Crypto:** Gold (GC=F), Crude Oil (CL=F), Bitcoin (BTC-USD)  
- **Defensive/Staples:** UL, PEP, WMT  
- **Benchmark:** S&P 500 (^GSPC)  
- **Risk-free proxy:** 3-Month T-Bill (^IRX)

The workflow includes:
- Return construction + descriptive stats
- Normality + stationarity checks
- Portfolio optimization:
  - Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)
  - Tangency (max Sharpe) portfolio
  - Efficient frontier (with and without short sales)
- Risk estimation:
  - Historical **VaR / Expected Shortfall**
  - Bootstrap confidence intervals
- Dimensionality reduction:
  - **PCA** (Scree + interpretation)
  - **Factor Analysis** (6-factor model + rotation)
- Tail dependence:
  - Copula model comparison (Gaussian vs Student-t vs Archimedean)

## Key Findings (High-Level)

- Returns show **significant non-normality**, especially for BTC and high-growth tech, motivating tail-aware risk modeling.
- The **Tangency portfolio** exhibits a “barbell” style: heavy weights in **Gold (GC=F)** with exposure to high-return tech (e.g., NVDA), balancing return potential with diversification benefits.
- A **two-fund separation / CML strategy** (T-Bills + Tangency) dramatically reduces downside risk at a conservative target return:
  - **~88% reduction in VaR** vs. holding risky assets only (for a 6% annual target).
- Copula analysis favors the **Student-t copula**, indicating **tail dependence** (correlations rise in crashes), meaning diversification can weaken during stress events.

## How to Run

### Option A — Run in Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Upload the notebook to Colab (or open from GitHub).
2. Run all cells top-to-bottom.
3. The notebook installs required packages via pip (see Requirements below).

### Option B — Run Locally (Jupyter)
1. Create an environment (recommended).
2. Install dependencies.
3. Launch Jupyter and run the notebook.

Core packages used:
- `yfinance`
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels` (if used for stationarity/ADF in your environment)
- `factor_analyzer`
- `copulae`

Install (example):
